= camel-kafka-rhoas project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.
It produces and consumes Kafka messages using camel-quarkus-kafka extension.

This example shows how to use Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka using RHOAS on Openshift.

== Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

[source,shell script]
----
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev

----

____

*_NOTE:_*  The dev mode uses Quarkus DevServices, that starts testContainers for development mode. We'll be using the Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka after deploying to Openshift.

____


==== Prerequisites
Before deploying the application to Openshift cluster, you'd need to follow these steps:

- Setup an instance and your topic named `Test`, you can follow up the https://cloud.redhat.com/beta/application-services/streams/resources[UI quickstart] or use the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_streams_for_apache_kafka/1/guide/f520e427-cad2-40ce-823d-96234ccbc047[rhoas CLI].
- Install https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_streams_for_apache_kafka/1/guide/f520e427-cad2-40ce-823d-96234ccbc047#_8818f0d5-ae20-42c8-9622-a98e663ff1a8[RHOAS cli]
- In the openshift cluster, install these 2 operators: https://github.com/redhat-developer/service-binding-operator/blob/master/README.md[Service Binding Operator] and https://github.com/redhat-developer/app-services-operator/tree/main/docs[RHOAS Operator]
- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_streams_for_apache_kafka/1/guide/f520e427-cad2-40ce-823d-96234ccbc047#_e081dde5-54e8-4cd2-81e5-4a53bf1f4338[Login to your Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka account using RHOAS cli].
----
$ rhoas login
----
- Connect to Openshift cluster, and select the proper Openshift project and the proper Kafka instance.
----
$ rhoas cluster connect
----

- Check that the KafkaConnection has been created successfully in the cluster.
----
$ oc get KafkaConnection
NAME   AGE
test   35s
----

==== Deploy on openshift

----
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true
----

The pods should be failing, because the kafka instance is not deployed in the cluster, but Managed elsewhere.

----
$ oc get pods
NAME                                           READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
camel-kafka-rhoas-b4c77d76b-rjl8c   0/1     Error    1          9s
----

____

*_NOTE:_*  To bind the application, we need a valid deployment. I use here a containerized version of my application using docker.

____


==== Bind the application using ServiceBinding Resource

You can create the ServiceBinding resource by updating the `conf/kafka-binding.yaml`. Make sure the namespace corresponds to your current openshift project.

----
$ oc apply -f conf/kafka-binding.yaml
servicebinding.binding.operators.coreos.com/kafka-config created
----

Check the container has been regenerated and that the new pod is not failing anymore.
----
$ oc get pods
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
camel-kafka-rhoas-67b5494fc-xqzd7   1/1     Running   0          6m16s
----

To clean up do.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc delete all -l app.kubernetes.io/name=camel-kafka-rhoas
$ oc delete  ServiceBinding/kafka-config
----

==== Bind the application using RHOAS cli

To bind the Kafka instance to the camel-quarkus-example-kafka project, use the `rhoas cluster bind` and select the camel-quarkus-example-kafka project from the list.
----
$ rhoas cluster bind
----
The application is visible while attempting to bind, due to the https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes#service-binding[Quarkus service binding extension].
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-kubernetes-service-binding</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Select the app. Check the container has been regenerated and that the new pod is not failing anymore.
----
$ oc get pods
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
camel-kafka-rhoas-67b5494fc-xqzd7   1/1     Running   0          6m16s
----

To clean up do.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc delete all -l app.kubernetes.io/name=camel-kafka-rhoas
